    <p>I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://gmlg.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graph Machine Learning Group</a>, within the Swiss AI lab <a href="https://www.idsia.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IDSIA</a> and <a href="https://www.usi.ch/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USI</a> - UniversitÃ  della Svizzera italiana (Switzerland), under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://alippi.faculty.polimi.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cesare Alippi</a>. Additionally, I am enrolled in the <a href="https://ellis.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ELLIS</a> Ph.D. program under the joint supervision of Prof. <a href="https://alippi.faculty.polimi.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cesare Alippi</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Bronstein</a>.</p>
    
    <p>I am currently on a research visit at the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Oxford</a>, collaborating with Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Bronstein</a>.</p>

    <p>Previously, I obtained BSc (2017) and MSc (2020) degrees in Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politecnico di Milano</a> (IT). My master thesis project has been supervised by Prof. <a href="https://gatti.faculty.polimi.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicola Gatti</a>.</p>

  research: >
    <p>My research focuses on <strong>graph deep learning</strong> for <strong>irregular spatiotemporal data</strong>. I study the problems of <strong>imputation</strong>, <strong>regularization</strong>, and <strong>prediction</strong> of data coming over time from both physical and virtual <strong>sensor networks</strong>.</p>
