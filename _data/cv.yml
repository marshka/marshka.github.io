summary: >
  <p>I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://gmlg.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graph Machine Learning Group</a>, within the Swiss AI lab <a href="https://www.idsia.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IDSIA</a>, at Università della Svizzera italiana (<a href="https://www.usi.ch/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USI</a>), under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://alippi.faculty.polimi.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cesare Alippi</a>.
  My research focuses on problems regarding <strong>irregular spatiotemporal data</strong>, like prediction, imputation, and control on sensor networks.</p>
  <p>I obtained BSc (2017) and MSc (2020) degrees in Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politecnico di Milano</a>. My master thesis project has been supervised by Prof. <a href="https://gatti.faculty.polimi.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicola Gatti</a>.</p>
