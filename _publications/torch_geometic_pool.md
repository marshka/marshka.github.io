    We introduce Torch Geometric Pool (tgp), a library for hierarchical pooling in Graph Neural Networks. Built upon Pytorch Geometric, Torch Geometric Pool (tgp) provides a wide variety of pooling operators, unified under a consistent API and a modular design. The library emphasizes usability and extensibility, and includes features like precomputed pooling, which significantly accelerate training for a class of operators. In this paper, we present tgp's structure and present an extensive benchmark. The latter showcases the library's features and systematically compares the performance of the implemented graph-pooling methods in different downstream tasks. The results, showing that the choice of the optimal pooling operator depends on tasks and data at hand, support the need for a library that enables fast prototyping.
